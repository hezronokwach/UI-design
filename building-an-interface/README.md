This repository contains a series of Figma files showcasing the design process for an e-commerce app focused on second-hand electronic devices. The project includes the creation of a style guide, design system, high-fidelity screens, and results from a desirability test.

## Project Overview

### Completed Tasks

1. **Style Guide**
 - Created a moodboard with pictures, a color palette, and typography examples for titles, descriptions, content, and buttons.

2. **Design System Library**
  - Developed a design system containing at least 30 elements, including:
     - **Atoms**: Basic UI components like buttons and input fields.
     - **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms forming functional groups (e.g., form groups).
     - **Organisms**: Complex components made up of molecules (e.g., headers, footers).
     - **Multistate Variations**: At least 10 variations demonstrating different states of UI elements.

3. **High-Fidelity Screens**
  - Designed 5 high-fidelity screens that demonstrate the user flow for:
     - Arriving on the homepage.
     - Browsing content.
     - Checking a product page.
     - Adding a product to the cart.
     - Checking out.

4. **Animation**
   - Animated the 5 screens to create a high-fidelity prototype showcasing multistate interactions.

5. **Desirability Testing**
  - Conducted a desirability test to evaluate user impressions of the appâ€™s design:
     - Created an adjectives board with 25+ adjectives.
     - Collected feedback from 5 participants on their selected adjectives.
     - Documented outcomes and suggestions for improvement if necessary.
